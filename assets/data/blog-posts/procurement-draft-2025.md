## Introduction

**NOTE: This is a draft document under development by the Procurement & Commercial SIG. We are actively seeking feedback from members before final publication.**

Traditional procurement routes for healthcare construction projects often lead to:
- Cost overruns
- Programme delays  
- Adversarial relationships
- Poor risk allocation

This paper explores modern procurement methods that address these challenges.

## P22 Framework

The P22 (Procuring for Productivity and Public Value) framework was developed by NHS England to...

[DRAFT SECTION - TO BE EXPANDED]

Key principles:
- Early contractor involvement
- Integrated supply chains
- Standardised designs
- Performance-based specifications

### Case Studies Needed

We are currently collecting case study data from:
- Trust A (anonymised)
- Trust B (anonymised)  
- Trust C (anonymised)

Results will be published in March 2025.

## Two-Stage Open Book

[DRAFT - Content being developed]

Benefits:
- Price certainty at RIBA Stage 3
- Collaborative risk management
- Value engineering opportunities

Challenges identified:
- Requires trust in contractor's cost data
- Limited competition at Stage 2
- Need for strong commercial management

## Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DfMA)

Modular construction approaches are gaining traction in healthcare.

### Advantages

✅ Faster construction (40-50% time savings)
✅ Quality control (factory conditions)
✅ Reduced site disruption
✅ Lower whole-life costs

### Challenges

❌ Design standardisation required
❌ Planning approval concerns
❌ Transport and installation logistics
❌ Perception issues ("prefab")

## Procurement Decision Tree

[DIAGRAM TO BE ADDED]

The SIG is developing a decision tree tool to help trusts select appropriate procurement routes based on:
- Project value
- Complexity
- Risk profile
- Market conditions
- Time constraints

## Early Findings

Based on preliminary research across 8 trusts:

| Procurement Route | Average Cost Variance | Programme Variance | Client Satisfaction |
|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Traditional (JCT) | +12% | +6 months | 3.2/5 |
| Design & Build | +8% | +3 months | 3.5/5 |
| Two-Stage | +3% | +1 month | 4.1/5 |
| P22 | -2% | On time | 4.4/5 |

*Note: Sample size limited, data requires validation*

## Next Steps

The Procurement & Commercial SIG is working on:

1. **Full case study development** (March 2025)
2. **Procurement route comparison tool** (April 2025)
3. **Best practice guide** (May 2025)
4. **Webinar series** with expert speakers (Q2 2025)

## Feedback Requested

We specifically need input on:

- Additional case studies from members
- Experience with P22 framework
- Challenges with DfMA in healthcare
- Commercial management lessons learned
