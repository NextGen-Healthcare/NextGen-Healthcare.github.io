## Executive Summary

Over the fourth quarter of 2024, the Energy & Sustainability SIG conducted comprehensive research across **15 NHS trusts** in England, analyzing energy consumption patterns, renewable energy adoption, and carbon reduction strategies.

Our findings reveal promising trends while highlighting significant challenges that require immediate attention from healthcare infrastructure leaders.

### Key Findings

1. **Average reduction of 12%** in natural gas consumption compared to Q4 2023
2. **Solar panel ROI** has improved by 18 months due to increased energy costs
3. **Heat pump adoption** has increased 3x year-over-year
4. **LED lighting retrofits** show 40% energy savings with 2-year payback periods

## Methodology

We collected data using a combination of:

- Direct meter readings from participating trusts
- Energy Management System (EMS) data exports
- Financial data from procurement teams
- Qualitative interviews with estates managers

All participating trusts signed data sharing agreements, and individual trust data remains confidential. Only aggregated results are presented in this report.

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Natural Gas Consumption Trends

The 12% reduction in gas consumption can be attributed to several factors:

- **Improved building fabric**: 8 trusts completed insulation upgrades
- **Behavioural changes**: Staff awareness campaigns reduced heating setpoints
- **Plant upgrades**: 5 trusts installed high-efficiency boilers

> "The combination of technical upgrades and staff engagement has been transformational. We've seen sustained reductions without compromising patient comfort."

### 2. Renewable Energy Adoption

Solar PV installations have accelerated significantly:

| Installation Type | Q4 2023 | Q4 2024 | Growth |
|------------------|---------|---------|--------|
| Rooftop Solar    | 12 MW   | 18 MW   | +50%   |
| Ground-mounted   | 3 MW    | 5 MW    | +67%   |
| Battery Storage  | 2 MWh   | 6 MWh   | +200%  |

The improved ROI (now averaging 8-10 years vs. 10-12 years previously) is driving increased investment from trust boards.

### 3. Heat Pump Technology

Air-source and ground-source heat pump installations have tripled:

- **New builds**: All new facilities include heat pumps in design
- **Retrofits**: 3 trusts successfully retrofitted wing heating systems
- **Lessons learned**: Water temperature requirements for infection control remain a challenge

#### Case Study: District General Hospital

A 500-bed district general hospital replaced gas boilers with a hybrid system:

- Ground-source heat pumps for base load heating
- Gas boilers retained for peak demand and hot water
- **Result**: 35% reduction in gas consumption
- **Payback**: Projected 12 years with current carbon pricing

### 4. LED Lighting Programmes

The most cost-effective intervention continues to be LED retrofits:

```
Average Investment: £150,000 per trust
Average Annual Savings: £75,000
Payback Period: 2 years
Additional Benefits:
  - Reduced maintenance costs (LED lifespan 50,000+ hours)
  - Improved light quality for clinical spaces
  - Reduced cooling loads in summer
```

## Challenges Identified

While progress is encouraging, significant barriers remain:

1. **Capital funding constraints**: Many trusts lack upfront capital for cost-effective upgrades
2. **Technical expertise**: Estates teams need training on new technologies
3. **Supply chain delays**: Heat pump and battery storage lead times extend 6-12 months
4. **Decarbonisation of heat**: Hot water requirements for healthcare present unique challenges

## Recommendations

Based on our research, we recommend:

### For Individual Trusts

- Prioritise **LED retrofits** for immediate ROI
- Conduct **thermal imaging surveys** to identify heat loss
- Establish **energy reduction targets** linked to board KPIs
- Engage **staff and patients** in behaviour change programmes

### For System Leaders

- Establish **regional energy hubs** to share expertise
- Create **pooled procurement frameworks** for renewable technologies
- Advocate for **capital funding mechanisms** specifically for decarbonisation
- Support **training programmes** for estates professionals

### For Policy Makers

- Extend **enhanced capital allowances** for renewable technologies
- Simplify **planning processes** for solar and battery installations
- Provide **long-term carbon price signals** to support business cases
- Fund **demonstration projects** for innovative technologies

## Next Steps

The Energy & Sustainability SIG will continue this research programme in Q1 2025, expanding to **25 participating trusts** and adding focus areas:

- **Electric vehicle charging infrastructure**
- **On-site renewable energy generation and storage**
- **Hydrogen readiness assessments**
- **Circular economy approaches to medical equipment**

## Get Involved

If your organisation would like to participate in future research or access the detailed data pack, please contact the SIG through the NextGen Healthcare Network.

We meet monthly via Microsoft Teams to discuss latest developments and share best practices.
