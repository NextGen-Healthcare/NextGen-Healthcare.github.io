## üöÄ Getting Started

### What You Need

- **GitHub account** with access to the repository
- **Web browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- **Text editor** (Notepad, TextEdit, or VS Code)

### Understanding the Structure

Think of the website like a filing cabinet:
- **events.json** = List of all events
- **gallery.json** = Photo album index
- **sigs.json** = Special Interest Groups directory
- **sig-blog-index.json** = Blog post catalog

These files are like address books - they tell the website where to find information and how to display it.

### How to Edit Files

**Option 1: Edit Directly on GitHub (Easiest)**
1. Go to the repository on GitHub.com
2. Navigate to the file you want to edit
3. Click the pencil icon (Edit this file)
4. Make your changes
5. Scroll down and click "Commit changes"
6. Add a description of what you changed
7. Click "Commit changes" again

**Option 2: Edit Locally (More Control)**
1. Download the repository to your computer
2. Edit files with a text editor
3. Upload (commit) changes back to GitHub

üí° **Tip**: Start with Option 1 until you're comfortable!

## üìÖ Adding Events

Events appear on the main homepage and the Events page.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Open the events file**
   - File location: `assets/data/events.json`
   - Click the pencil icon to edit

2. **Copy this template** for a new event:

```json
{
  "id": "unique-event-id-2025",
  "title": "Coffee & Catch-Up - Manchester",
  "date": "2025-12-15",
  "time": "18:00‚Äì19:30",
  "location": "Manchester",
  "category": "coffee",
  "categoryLabel": "Coffee & Catch-Ups",
  "short": "Informal networking over coffee",
  "details": "Join us at Costa Coffee, Oxford Road. Look for the NextGen group near the back. All welcome!",
  "link": "https://www.eventbrite.com/your-event"
}
```

3. **Fill in your event details**:

   - **id**: A unique name (use lowercase with hyphens, e.g., `2025-coffee-manchester-dec`)
   - **title**: The event name
   - **date**: Format as YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2025-12-15 for 15th Dec 2025)
   - **time**: Use format HH:MM‚ÄìHH:MM with 24-hour clock
   - **location**: City or venue name
   - **category**: Choose from:
     - `coffee` - Coffee & Catch-Ups
     - `network` - Network Sessions

   - **details**: Full description with venue, parking, what to expect
   - **link**: URL for RSVP/tickets (LinkedIn, Eventbrite, etc.)

4. **Add your event to the list**:

   - Find the opening `[` bracket at the start of the file
   - Paste your event AFTER this bracket
   - Make sure to add a **comma** after the closing `}` if there are other events below it

   Example:
   ```json
   [
     {
       "id": "your-new-event",
       "title": "New Event",
       ...
     },
     {
       "id": "existing-event",
       "title": "Existing Event",
       ...
     }
   ]
   ```

5. **Check your formatting**:
   - Every opening `{` needs a closing `}`
   - Every opening `[` needs a closing `]`
   - Put commas between items, but NOT after the last item
   - Use double quotes `"` not single quotes `'`

6. **Save your changes**:
   - Scroll to bottom
   - Add commit message: "Add [event name] to events"
   - Click "Commit changes"

### ‚úÖ Checklist Before Saving

---

## üì∏ Adding Photos to Gallery

The gallery displays photos from past events organized by date and category.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### Part 1: Upload the Photos

1. **Prepare your photos**:
   - Rename files simply: `01.jpeg`, `02.jpeg`, `03.jpeg`, etc.
   - File format: JPEG or JPG (preferred) or PNG
   - Recommended: Resize to max 1920px wide to keep files small

2. **Create a folder for your event**:
   - Location: `assets/img/gallery/`
   - Folder name format: `YYYY-MM-DD-category-location`
   - Examples:
     - `2025-12-15-coffee-manchester`
     - `2025-11-20-network-session`
     - `2025-10-10-iheem-birmingham`

3. **Upload photos to this folder**:
   - On GitHub: Navigate to `assets/img/gallery/`
   - Click "Add file" ‚Üí "Upload files"
   - Create new folder by typing folder name in the filename box
   - Drag and drop your photos
   - Commit changes

#### Part 2: Add to Gallery Index

1. **Open the gallery file**:
   - File location: `assets/data/gallery.json`
   - Click the pencil icon to edit

2. **Find the `"photosByEvent"` section**:
   - It looks like this:
   ```json
   "photosByEvent": {
     "2024-10-08-iheem": [
       ...existing photos...
     ],
   ```

3. **Add your event**:
   - Copy this template:
   ```json
   "2025-12-15-coffee-manchester": [
     { "src": "../assets/img/gallery/2025-12-15-coffee-manchester/01.jpeg", "alt": "Coffee & Catch-Up ‚Äì Manchester" },
     { "src": "../assets/img/gallery/2025-12-15-coffee-manchester/02.jpeg", "alt": "Coffee & Catch-Up ‚Äì Manchester" },
     { "src": "../assets/img/gallery/2025-12-15-coffee-manchester/03.jpeg", "alt": "Coffee & Catch-Up ‚Äì Manchester" }
   ],
   ```

4. **Customize the template**:
   - Change the folder name to match YOUR folder
   - Add one line for EACH photo
   - Update the numbers (01, 02, 03, etc.)
   - Update the description in "alt" (what the photo shows)
   - Add comma at the end of the closing `],` EXCEPT for the very last event

5. **Save your changes**:
   - Commit message: "Add gallery photos for [event name]"
   - Click "Commit changes"

### Understanding the Folder Name Format

The folder name tells the website important information:

```
2025-12-15-coffee-manchester
‚îÇ    ‚îÇ  ‚îÇ  ‚îÇ      ‚îî‚îÄ Location
‚îÇ    ‚îÇ  ‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Category (coffee, network, iheem, drinks, sig)
‚îÇ    ‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Day
‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ Month
‚îî‚îÄ Year
```

The website automatically:
- Sorts by date (newest first)
- Creates filter buttons for each category
- Shows location in the title

### ‚úÖ Checklist Before Saving

- [ ] Folder name follows YYYY-MM-DD-category-location format
- [ ] Photos are named simply (01.jpeg, 02.jpeg, etc.)
- [ ] Each photo has an entry in gallery.json
- [ ] File paths match exactly (including .jpeg or .jpg)
- [ ] Alt text describes what's in the photo
- [ ] Commas are correct between items

## üìù Publishing Blog Posts

Blog posts are written in **Markdown** - a simple way to format text without HTML.

### Understanding Markdown

Markdown uses simple symbols for formatting:

```markdown
# Large Heading
## Medium Heading
### Smaller Heading

**Bold text**
*Italic text*

- Bullet point
- Another bullet point

1. Numbered item
2. Another numbered item

[Link text](https://example.com)
![Image description](path/to/image.jpg)
```

### Creating a New Blog Post

#### Part 1: Write the Post

1. **Open a text editor** (Notepad, TextEdit, VS Code)

2. **Start with the frontmatter** (metadata about the post):

```markdown
---
id: my-post-2025
sigId: sig-energy
sigName: Energy & Sustainability
title: My Blog Post Title
date: 2025-10-23
author: Your Name
authorRole: Your Job Title
excerpt: A one-sentence summary that appears on the blog card view
tags: [keyword1, keyword2, keyword3]
published: false
---
```

3. **Write your content** below the `---`:

```markdown
## Introduction

Write your introduction paragraph here...

### Key Points

1. First main point
2. Second main point
3. Third main point

## Main Content

Add your detailed content here with paragraphs, bullet points, and headings.

}
```

3. **Important**: Add comma after the previous post's closing `}`

4. **Save changes**

#### Part 3: Preview Your Draft

Your post starts as a **draft** (`published: false`), which means only people with the special preview link can see it.

**Preview URL format**:
```
https://yoursite.com/pages/sig-blog.html?preview=true#my-post-2025
```

Share this link with colleagues to get feedback before publishing!

#### Part 4: Publish Your Post

When you're ready to make it public:

1. **In the markdown file** (`my-post-2025.md`):
   - Change `published: false` to `published: true`

2. **In the index file** (`sig-blog-index.json`):
   - Change `"published": false` to `"published": true`

3. **Commit both changes**

Your post will now appear on the public blog page!

- [ ] Markdown formatting looks correct in preview
- [ ] Ready to publish? Change `published: false` to `true` in BOTH files

### üîí Blog Privacy & Access Control

The blog page is currently **hidden from search engines** (so drafts stay private). To change this later, a developer needs to remove the `noindex` tag.

**Different Ways to View the Blog:**

**Public view** (only published posts show):
```
https://yoursite.com/pages/sig-blog.html
```

**Preview mode** (includes draft posts - share this link with colleagues):
```
https://yoursite.com/pages/sig-blog.html?preview=true
```

**Direct link to specific post** (for sharing):
```
https://yoursite.com/pages/sig-blog.html#post-id
```

**Preview a specific draft** (share privately before publishing):
```
https://yoursite.com/pages/sig-blog.html?preview=true#post-id
```

üí° **Tip**: Use preview links to get feedback on drafts before making them public!

### üì± Making the Blog Public

When you're ready to make the blog accessible to everyone:

1. **Ask a developer** to remove this line from `pages/sig-blog.html`:
   ```html
   <meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">
   ```

2. **Add blog link** to the main navigation menu on other pages

3. **Announce it** on LinkedIn, in newsletters, etc.

## üí° Tips for Success

### General Best Practices

‚úÖ **Always make a small test change first** - Get comfortable with the process before making big updates

‚úÖ **Write clear commit messages** - Future you will thank you! Example: "Add Manchester coffee event for December"

‚úÖ **Preview before publishing** - Use preview mode for blog posts, check the live site for other updates

‚úÖ **Keep backups** - Copy the original text before editing, just in case

‚úÖ **Be consistent** - Follow existing naming patterns and formatting styles

‚úÖ **Ask for help** - It's better to ask than to break something!

### Quality Checks

Before any update, ask yourself:

- [ ] Is the information accurate?
- [ ] Are dates and times correct?
- [ ] Do all links work?
- [ ] Is spelling and grammar correct?
- [ ] Does formatting look right?
- [ ] Have I tested in preview (if applicable)?

### Making Changes Safely

1. **Edit**: Make your changes in the file
2. **Review**: Read through what you changed
3. **Commit**: Save with a clear message
4. **Check**: View the live website to confirm it worked
5. **Fix**: If something's wrong, you can edit again!

GitHub keeps a history of all changes, so you can always go back if needed.
